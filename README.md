# Overview

SwiftWallet is a sophisticated library designed for managing application
wallets, offering both a basic memory cache and an encrypted storage
option backed by the iOS Keychain via SecureVault. This README outlines
the library’s functionality, demonstrates its usage, and discusses
security considerations.

# Features

SwiftWallet provides the following key features:

1.  **Encrypted Wallet Storage:** Utilizes the iOS Keychain via
    SecureVault to create an encrypted store for persisting an app
    wallet securely.

2.  **Basic Wallet Operations:** Offers essential wallet operations,
    including adding tokens, consuming tokens, checking the balance, and
    determining whether tokens can be consumed.

3.  **Bundle Tokens:** Supports bundle tokens, which can include one or
    multiple tokens and can have specific expiration dates.

4.  **Unexpired Token Bundles:** Allows the wallet to compute through
    unexpired token bundles, ensuring that all tokens can be consumed.

5.  **Robust Testing:** Comes with comprehensive test cases to ensure
    reliability and correctness.

6.  **Memory Cache and SecureVault:** Provides options for both a simple
    memory cache solution and a secure SecureVault implementation for
    storage.

7.  **Sample Implementations:** Includes sample implementations for both
    memory cache and SecureVault storage.

# Usage

<div class="note">

=== This README provides code snippets and examples for understanding
SwiftWallet’s usage. In real-world applications, it is recommended to
manage sensitive wallet operations server-side for enhanced security.

</div>

===

``` swift
// Define Bundle Types
enum BundleType: WalletBundle {
    case day
    case week
    case month
    case year

    var tokens: Int {
        switch self {
            // Define token counts for different bundle types
        }
    }

    var expiration: Date {
        switch self {
            // Define expiration dates for different bundle types
        }
    }
}

// Create a WalletManager with Memory Cache
let wallet = WalletManager(storage: WalletCache<BundleType>())

// Add Tokens to the Wallet
let bundle = BundleType.week
wallet.addToken(bundle: bundle)

// Consume Tokens
let result = wallet.consumeToken()

// Check Balance
let balance = wallet.getBalance()

// Determine If Tokens Can Be Consumed
let canConsume = wallet.canConsumeTokens(count: 1)
```

For a more comprehensive example and detailed usage, please refer to the
SwiftWallet documentation and unit tests.

# Security Considerations

SwiftWallet provides enhanced security by utilizing the iOS Keychain
through SecureVault. This offers the following advantages:

- **Data Encryption:** Wallet data is stored in an encrypted format,
  protecting it from unauthorized access.

- **iOS Keychain Integration:** Leveraging the iOS Keychain adds an
  extra layer of security, making it challenging for hackers to access
  wallet data.

- **SecureVault Implementation:** SecureVault ensures that data remains
  secure, even in the face of potential threats.

However, it’s essential to consider the following caveats:

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** SwiftWallet serves as an MVP for
  wallet management. In real-world scenarios, sensitive wallet
  operations should ideally be managed server-side to minimize potential
  security threats.

- **Server-Side Management:** For maximum security, consider handling
  critical wallet operations, such as adding or consuming tokens, on the
  server side.

Please use SwiftWallet responsibly and follow best practices to protect
sensitive data.
